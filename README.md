# Bitwise-operators in C 

The bitwise operators are the operators used to perform the operations on the data at the bit-level.

Example:

We have two variables a and b. 
a =6;  
b=4;  
The binary representation of the above two variables are given below:  
a = 0110  
b = 0100  

When we apply the different bitwise operation in the above two variables, the output would be:  
a&b -  Result = 0100  i.e 4 
a|b -  Result = 0110  i.e 6 
a^b -  Result = 0010  i.e 2 

Right Shift Operator
Right shift operator shifts all bits towards right by certain number of specified bits. It is denoted by >> .

a = 0111
a>>2 ;  
0000 0111 >> 2 = 0000 0001 
Left-shift operator
It is an operator that shifts the number of bits to the left-side.

a = 0101  
a << 2;  
0101<<2 = 00010100 

# To check if the number is even or odd using BITWISE Operator:
 ALGORITHM:
 
    1. Input a number from user.
    
    2. Check if (num & 1)
    
    3. If true , the number is odd.
    
    4. Else , Even.
